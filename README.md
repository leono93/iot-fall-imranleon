This project revolves around creating a functional IoT system.

The core idea of this project is to create an IoT weatherstation that uses a Raspberry Pi with Environmental Sensor to collect data. This data is then stored on a server, and retrieved through a web application and displayed to the user.

Data from a public API is also displayed in this application. The purpose of this is to offer comparison and insight in the accuracy of the data.
